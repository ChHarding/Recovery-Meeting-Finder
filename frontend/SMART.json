As Im apart of both, I will work diligently for this new meeting to advance and well known, not only in Columbus, Indiana, but everywhere, as this is making history for people in my community, the state, and every person that needs support and especially support of this nature in recovery which I know personally, has been needed so much for so long and Im incredibly grateful for this opportunity to help make these changes as best as I can! Apologies for the long comment, but I felt I had to let it be known and appreciated! The meeting will be open and I also want to make an online meeting available as well, but I am being cautious for the participants as safety is number one on my list for the participants and I plan to have some meetings outdoors when the weather is nice enough, possibly around the library if thats excepted. I will be letting the participants eventually plan or volunteer their thoughts for talking points for meetings in the future. Also, ANYONE can come to this meeting, as long as they 100% supportive of the LGBTQIA community as well as 100% respectful both in and outside the meeting. Anyone that says any homophobic and/or derogatory comments of any kind towards any of the participants in regards to their sexual orientation, ethnicity, pro-nouns, etc. will not be allowed back at the meeting.
